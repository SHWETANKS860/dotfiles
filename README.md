# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for Arch Linux with Hyprland, Waybar, Kitty, Ranger, Waypaper, Wlogout, and Wofi.

## Features
- **Hyprland**: Tiling Wayland compositor for a dynamic workflow.
- **Waybar**: Customizable status bar for system information.
- **Kitty**: Fast and feature-rich terminal emulator.
- **Ranger**: Terminal-based file manager with Vim-like keybindings.
- **Waypaper**: Simple wallpaper manager for Wayland.
- **Wlogout**: Logout menu for Wayland environments.
- **Wofi**: Application launcher and dmenu replacement.

## Warning
**Backup or remove your existing configuration files before proceeding, as this will overwrite them!**
